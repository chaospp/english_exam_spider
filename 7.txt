Peter always doesn’t know the way. His friends often laugh at him. They say he needs a map to find the bathroom in his own house. In his eyes, every street looks the same, and he doesn’t know which way to go. Sometimes he has to take a taxi home because he can’t remember the way to his house.Peter watches a lot of films and reads a lot of books about animals. Each bird knows which way is south. Bats (蝙蝠) can fly at night and find their way with their ears. He feels embarrassed (困窘的) because all these animals have a good sense of direction. He tries to find his way with the help of stars in the sky. There is a star called the North Star, and he knows how to find it.Of course, Peter’s friends are still laughing at him, because he can only see the North Star outside when it is sunny at night. He can’t tell the directions in the daytime or when he is inside or when it is cloudy.1.Sometimes Peter has to take a taxi home because __________.A. he is tired after shoppingB. he doesn’t know the way homeC. he likes taking the taxi                　　D. his friends want him to do that2.Bats find the way with their __________.A. ears                B. mouths        C. noses            D. eyes3.What does the phrase “sense of direction” mean in Chinese?A. 幽默感             B. 责任感        C. 幸福感        D. 方向感4.Peter’s friends still laugh at him because he __________.① can’t still find his way in the daytime　　② can’t still find his way when he is inside③ can’t still find his way when it is cloudy④ can see the North Star outsideA. ①③                B. ①②            C. ①②③        D. ①②③④七年级英语阅读理解中等难度题
